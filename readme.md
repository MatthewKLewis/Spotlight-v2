# Spotlight v2
Spotlight is an Internet of Things enabled Realtime spotlighting system, built over the wonderful DMX-512 controller library at https://github.com/node-dmx/dmx.
Spotlight's backend uses MQTT to publish a stream of coordinates in 3D space, which are subscribed to by a spotlight controller which performs trigonometric operations.
This system was demo'd by AiRISTA at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Convention, August 2021.
